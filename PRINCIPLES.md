# Principles

- Transparency first: always show where data is stored and make persistence self-documenting.
- Local-first processing: data stays on the user's machine; sanitization happens client-side.
- Plain text where possible: prefer human-readable formats like TOML, JSON, JSONL.
- Flexible backend: remain backend-agnostic so data can flow to multiple destinations.
- Two UI surfaces: maintain a static demo site and a full web app that share core logic.
